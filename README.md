# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to My GitHub Profile

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## About Me

I’m a passionate developer dedicated to building high-quality solutions and learning new technologies every day. Passionate front-end developer and data science enthusiast with a strong foundation in building responsive, user-first web applications using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Experienced in UI/UX collaboration, Git version control, and prototyping with Figma to deliver polished digital experiences.

I have demonstrated strong analytical skills through the Deloitte Data Analytics Simulation, where I created insightful Tableau dashboards and performed in-depth data manipulation in Excel. Currently, I am expanding my expertise in Python-based data science, working with pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

With a solid programming background in Java and C++, I graduated top of my class with a 9.37 CGPA (1st rank) in B.Tech Information Technology. I am committed to continuous learning, clean code practices, and delivering data-driven solutions that make a real-world impact.
